Ingredients;

3 eggs
2 cans of tuna (360g)
One stale bread roll
Pepper
Chilli flakes

Method:

1 In a bowl, crumble the stale bread roll into crumbs, the smaller the better. If you don't have a stale roll, put a fresh one in the microwave for 1 minute.
2 drain the cans of tuna and add the tuna into the bowl.
3 crack the eggs and add them to the mix.
4 add pepper and chilli flakes to taste
5 mix them all up in the bowl. The eggs should bind the mixture together.
6 add some oil to a hot frying pan, and add dollops of the mixture to the pan. Flatten them into burger shapes and fry for a few minutes either side. I find
that this recipe makes 4 largish tuna patties - great for breakfast!
